  summary: Atlite converts climate weather data for Power Systems Analysis
  description: |
    Atlite is a free software, xarray-based Python library for converting
    weather data (such as wind speeds, solar radiation, temperature and
    runoff) into power systems data (such as wind power, solar power, hydro
    power and heating demand time series). It is designed to work with big
    datasets, such as hourly global weather data over several years at spatial
    resolutions down to e.g. 0.1 x 0.1 degree resolution.
